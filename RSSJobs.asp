<title>Executive Director - Collaborative for Educational Services - Northampton, Massachusetts</title>
<link>http://www.execsearches.com/non-profit-jobs/jobDetail.asp?job_id=26606</link>
<description>The Board of Governors of the Collaborative for Educational Services, based in Northampton, Massachusetts, seeks a dynamic and experienced Executive Director.  For over 35 years, the Collaborative has worked to develop and foster educational excellence and opportunity for all learners through collaboration and leadership. The Collaborative serves learners, educators and communities in Franklin and Hampshire Counties, throughout the Commonwealth, and beyond.

The Organization

The Collaborative for Educational Services (formerly known as Hampshire Educational Collaborative) is a community of innovative and effective professionals dedicated to improving education.  It began by providing education programs for member school districts but quickly expanded when the State ordered school districts to educate children with special needs.  When districts needed programs for students with behavioral and emotional issues, the Collaborative (CES) started some of the first alternative programs in the Commonwealth.  With the passage of Massachusetts¡¦ 1993 education reform law, professional development offerings were broadened, and shortages of special education, math and science teachers led to the start of educator licensure preparation programs.  CES also brings quality interventions, professional development and mental health consultation to early childhood providers and has improved teaching and learning in the state&apos;s DYS education program.  Changing lives is the common theme.

The Collaborative¡¦s annual revenue of approximately $34 million comes from Federal, State and other grants and contracts, professional development fees, special education services, and administration.  The Board of Governors is comprised of an elected school committee representative from each of the 36 member school districts, and Steering Committees are composed of the Superintendents of Schools of the Franklin and Hampshire County member districts.  The staff of 575 provides educational opportunities to students and teachers.  It helps educators create school-wide solutions to their instructional challenges and helps districts collaborate to put resources where they¡¦re needed most - back in the classroom.  

Programs and services for learners/families include After School, Early Childhood, Special Education and Student Services. Programs and services for educators include Early Childhood, Professional Development, Resources and Support.  CES is a provider for the Department of Youth Services Education Initiative (DYS) and Special Education in Institutional Settings (SEIS).  

For more information, please visit www.collaborative.org. 

The Position

The new Executive Director (ED) will succeed Dr. Joan Schuman who has successfully led the Collaborative for twenty years.

In June 2013, the Board adopted the Building Stronger Families framework that articulates six core family- and community-level results First 5 LA seeks in order to improve long-term outcomes for children. These results incorporate the evidence-based Strengthening Families Protective Factors.  The Building Stronger Families framework reflects First 5 LA’s belief that if families are strong and communities support families, then children’s health, safety and school readiness will improve.

<title>Executive Director - Up Valley Family Resource Centers - Napa Valley, California</title>
<link>http://www.execsearches.com/non-profit-jobs/jobDetail.asp?job_id=26576</link>
<description>OVERVIEW
Up Valley Family Resource Centers is a new nonprofit organization resulting from the merger of two northern Napa Valley family resource centers—Calistoga Family Center and St. Helena Family Center—that voted in August 2013 to combine operations.   It brings together the management and program development of both organizations as it maintains and builds on its strong programming in both communities. The board of directors now seeks a skilled social service professional to lead the organization.
The successful candidate will have worked in and developed social and educational services for low income individuals and families, will be culturally competent in serving Hispanic clients and will have served in high level administrative positions.

The first executive of this new organization will be partnering with a board and a staff excited by the opportunity for growth and greater impact that melding the strengths of the two partner groups provides.   The executive will have a leading role in facilitating the pursuit of that vision.

MISSION AND PROGRAMMING
“Enhancing Lives, Strengthening Communities”       “Healthy Families.  Strong Community.”
The tag lines of the St. Helena and Calistoga centers succinctly state their missions. The agencies are the primary providers of social services in their rural, agricultural communities—providing information and guided referrals to all available services.  They are safe, accessible places for families to connect with comprehensive, coordinated services that help them strengthen their families and become more self-reliant.  Programs at each center are tailored to the culture, resources and needs of the community they serve, and focus on building on the strengths of each family and individual.  
Programming ranges from mental health services to parent and adult education, from preschool and early childhood development to afterschool student assistance.  The staffs of the two centers work with approximately 30 partner agencies.  Details on the multiple offerings at each location can be found on the websites of the two merging organizations – www.CalistogaFamilyCenter.org  and www.StHelenaFamilyCenter.org. 
The center’s client base is largely, but not exclusively, Hispanic and works in agriculture and in the service sector.  In 2012 SHFC served 1,515 people, 639 of these being children under 18.  Forty per cent of clients report annual incomes below $25,000 while only 3% report annual incomes over $50,000.  The CFC served 1,663 people, 798 of which were children under 18.  Seventy-one per cent of the Calistoga clients report annual income under $25,000 while 5% report annual income over $50,000.   

The annual operating budget of the new organization is $1.2 million.  There are 9 program staff members between the two centers.  Additionally, administrative staff includes two Senior Program Directors and an Operations Manager.  A Development Director position is funded but not yet filled.

<title>Executive Vice President - National Fire Sprinkler Association - Patterson, New York</title>
<link>http://www.execsearches.com/non-profit-jobs/jobDetail.asp?job_id=26561</link>
<description>The National Fire Sprinkler Association seeks a competent, multi-talented executive vice president to join the leadership team. This position provides an exciting opportunity for innovation, ability to develop as a leader, and capacity building to advance NFSA’s role as “the voice of the fire sprinkler industry.” 

&lt;b&gt;The Organization&lt;/b&gt;

Established in 1905, the National Fire Sprinkler Association (NFSA) represents all fire sprinkler industry interests including union and open-shop fire sprinkler contractors, manufacturers and suppliers of fire sprinklers and related equipment, and fire protection professionals.  NFSA works across the industry, focusing on one overarching goal:  properly designed, installed and maintained fire sprinkler systems in all buildings and structures.   

NFSA’s wide-ranging programs and services include developing publications, providing nationally accredited seminars, representing the industry in codes and standards-making bodies, developing new markets, and providing labor relations and other services to its membership.   The organization advances its work on behalf of the membership through eight departments:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Engineering department provides technician training, participates in the advancement of codes and standards, serves as technical experts, and provides other member services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Training &amp; Education department serves as a premier resource to the fire sprinkler industry, expanding course offerings and improving upon content and delivery methods.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Public Fire Protection department collaborates with industry partners to advocate public fire safety to legislators on Capitol Hill.  The department also works closely with Regional Operations to advance building and fire codes at the state and local level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Regional Operations team advances NFSA’s work across twelve regions of the US.  Their work includes membership recruitment and retention, promoting contractor licensure and initiating efforts to improve the business climate, and building the relationships necessary to move the fire sprinkler industry forward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Labor Relations department focuses on the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements on behalf of NFSA union contractor members.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Membership &amp; Communications department publishes the bi-monthly SQ magazine, promotes membership in all categories, and promotes NFSA products, programs and services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Internet Services department provides communications and technical support to all departments, ensuring that NFSA’s communications networks operate at peak efficiency.  The department also keeps an eye on emerging technologies to support NFSA’s mission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Finance department provides effective and accurate management of all NFSA financial information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Based in Patterson, NY, NFSA is governed by a 25-member board of directors and has an annual budget of approximately $7M.  The organization is led by NFSA President, Russell Fleming, and employs approximately 45 individuals.  The Executive Vice President oversees the work of approximately 35 of the employees. More information on NFSA may be found at www.nfsa.org.   

&lt;b&gt;The Position&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The Executive Vice President (EVP) reports directly to the President, who served as Executive Vice President before ascending to the President position.  The EVP has five direct reports:  Vice President of Regional Operations, Vice President of Engineering, Vice President of Training and Communications, Director of ITM (Inspection/Testing/Maintenance), and Director of Public Fire Protection.  Partnering with the President to advance the work of the association, this position is an active player in organization-wide planning, membership development, and operations management.

Externally, the EVP will represent the association through public speaking, communications with regional representatives and relationship building with industry partners.   

&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The successful candidate for this position will have the opportunity to grow his/her leadership duties and responsibilities within the association and potentially advance to the President position following the current President’s retirement in the next four to five years.

&lt;b&gt;Key Roles and Responsibilities&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The Executive Vice President works closely with the President, assisting in the management of the association, overseeing operating departments, ensuring high quality member services, and promoting the association.  Priority responsibilities include:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leading NFSA’s planning effort to assess the relationship between the national organization and its chapters, understand the needs of the association’s members, and develop a plan to advance the structure and work of the association, thereby increasing the organization’s impact and sustainability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gain a deep understanding and appreciation for the fire sprinkler industry, relevant opportunities, and challenges on the horizon; and build effective relationships with internal stakeholders (staff, board, councils, members, etc.) and external constituents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recommend, implement, and evaluate infrastructure realignments that would efficiently and effectively support the work of the association.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Additional duties include:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implement, evaluate, and update NFSA’s strategic and annual plans;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coordinate national programs;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oversee the preparation of annual budgets and personnel evaluations for individual departments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Attend and participate in staff meetings, board committee meetings, and seminars at the national and regional level;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure a cohesive team environment;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with department managers in developing annual and long-range plans and outcome measures;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Establish and maintain the highest quality training, communications, and member services, including those involving regional representatives;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participate in development of new members and partners throughout the industry;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lead branding or co-branding efforts, messaging and development of marketing content;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop policies and initiatives to promote the best practices for NFSA’s mission, members, and industry;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop and maintain the electronic infrastructure supporting association activities; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promote competency, quality and the highest ethical standards throughout the organization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

The Aspen Institute is an educational and policy studies organization based in Washington, DC. Its mission is to foster leadership based on enduring values and to provide a nonpartisan venue for dealing with critical issues. The Institute has campuses in Aspen, Colorado, and on the Wye River on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. It also maintains offices in New York City and has an international network of partners.


The Economic Opportunities Program (EOP) supports fields of practice that make economic opportunity more accessible to those who are struggling in the changing economy. EOP is composed of four related initiatives: Access to Capital and Credit, the Microenterprise Fund for Innovation, Effectiveness, Learning and Dissemination (FIELD), Skills for America’s Future, and the Workforce Strategies Initiative (WSI). 
(www.aspeninstitute.org/policy-work/economic-opportunities)

 

Skills for America’s Future (SAF), was launched in 2010 at The Aspen Institute by a founding advisory board chaired by Penny Pritzker.  SAF was originally established to foster and improve partnerships between employers and community colleges in order to serve two goals: first, to ensure that American workers have the skills they need to find and keep good jobs, and second, to provide employers with a workforce that is prepared to meet the global demands of a 21st century economy (www.skillsforamericasfuture.org). In its newly-updated strategic framework, SAF will focus on three core strategies:

 

Influence national policy and communications to support demand-driven workforce partnerships 
Spotlight and facilitate effective national demand-driven partnerships that close the skills gap 
Expand a local strategy of demand-driven workforce partnerships  beyond Chicago 
 

America’s ability to compete in a global economy depends on a workforce that possesses the skills required by employers. Skills for America’s Future (SAF) is a non-partisan, employer-led policy initiative of the Economic Opportunities Program (EOP) at the Aspen Institute in Washington, DC. SAF identifies solutions where education/training providers and employers work together to prepare individuals with the skills that will allow American businesses to be more productive, innovative and competitive.  The Director will lead Skills for America’s Future at a critical juncture as it embarks on a new strategic direction, guided by an engaged executive-level board of advisors.

In particular, the Director must manage integrated project execution strategies together with strategic allies such as the The National Skills Coalition, The HR Policy Association, Skills for Chicagoland’s Future, and the National Fund for Workforce Solutions , among others.  The Director  must be adept at taking initiative, working with senior and executive-level corporate representatives, meeting deadlines, and multi-tasking in a dynamic and creative environment.

 

Strategy and Vision: Experience setting the near and long-term vision for a young organization and executing against that vision, managing complex projects to completion and achieving outcomes within very short timelines.

He or she must have strong interpersonal skills with the gravitas to develop positive and productive relationships on all levels, including the senior-most levels of government and business.

<title>Chief Executive Officer - Association of Maternal &amp; Child Health Programs - Washington, D.C.</title>
<link>http://www.execsearches.com/non-profit-jobs/jobDetail.asp?job_id=26535</link>
<description>The Association of Maternal &amp; Child Health Programs (AMCHP)  is seeking a dynamic chief executive officer (CEO) to build on and preserve our mission of  being a national resource, partner, and advocate for state public health leaders and others working to  improve the  health of women, children, youth, and families, including those with special health care needs. 

&lt;b&gt;The Organization&lt;/b&gt;

Headquartered in Washington, DC, AMCHP is an organization committed to improving the quality of life for women, children, youth, and families, including those with special health care needs. Our mission is to support state maternal and child health programs and provide national leadership on issues affecting women and children. Our vision is to create a society where healthy children and healthy families are able to live in healthy sustainable communities. 

With the passing of the Social Security Act in 1935, the federal government, through Title V, pledged its support of state efforts to extend health and welfare services for mothers and children. This landmark legislation resulted in the establishment of state departments of health or public welfare in some states, and facilitated the efforts of existing agencies in others. Over the years, the achievements of Title V-supported projects have been integrated into the ongoing care system for children and families. Although Title V has been frequently amended over the years, the underlying goal has remained constant: continued improvement in the health, safety, and well-being of mothers and children.

AMCHP members come from the highest levels of state government and include directors of maternal and child health programs, directors of programs for children with special health care needs, and other public health leaders who work with and support state maternal and child health programs. Our members strive to improve the health of all women, infants, children and adolescents, including those with special health care needs, by administering critical public health education and screening services, and coordinating preventive, primary and specialty care. Our membership also includes academic, advocacy and community-based family health professionals, as well as families themselves.

AMCHP builds successful programs by disseminating best practices; advocating on members’ behalf in Washington; providing technical assistance; convening leaders to share experiences and ideas; and advising states about involving partners to reach our common goal of healthy children, healthy families, and healthy communities.

AMCHP currently receives support from the Maternal and Child Health Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Lucile Packard Foundation for Children&apos;s Health and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, in addition to the dues paid by AMCHP members.
The Association of Maternal &amp; Child Health Programs is governed by a 20 member board of directors. The organization’s budget is $4 million and there is a staff of 26 employees. For additional information please visit the AMCHP website at www.amchp.org. 

&lt;b&gt;The Position&lt;/b&gt;

Reporting to the board of directors, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) provides direction and leadership for organization mission and vision, represents and speaks for the organization and its work, and manages the day-to-day operations. The next executive will inherit an organization that is respected by its members, with a highly motivated and engaged staff, and a solid governing board. The implementation of health care reform, including the Affordable Care Act, will likely change the health care landscape over the coming years.  Among the issues raised by reform are: the role of maternal and child health in implementation; the varied ways in which states are viewing and realizing reform; AMCHP’s role in influencing these issues; and the future of Title V. 

&lt;b&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/b&gt;

Specific responsibilities of the CEO:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Effectively represent and promote the organization as the national voice for state and territorial maternal and child health programs &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Successfully manage day-to-day operations, including oversight of staff and programs, procedures and systems, human, infrastructure and technological resources&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oversee the organization’s fiscal operations and fund raising strategies and plans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop and implement initiatives to operationalize the organization’s strategic plan and priorities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oversee development and implementation of programs, initiatives, activities, products and services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support the board in its governance role, ensuring effective relationships, and assuring accountability to the board&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oversee member relations and the work of the organization committees, including oversight of the annual meeting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop and maintain relationships; and create partnerships with partners and stakeholders, which include: key federal agencies, national policymakers, organizations, foundations and the public&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leadership Outlook and Near-Term Priorities&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The AMCHP CEO plays a variety of leadership roles both inside and outside of the organization. With the passage and upcoming implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the health system field is rapidly changing and the future of Title V is of concern to the members. The CEO and board will determine AMCHP’s role in addressing the political, legislative and public health changes with an opportunity to lead discussions and advocate for policy that benefits the members, constituents and clients.

&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;The priority responsibilities of the new CEO for the first 12 – 18 months:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain relationships with stakeholders such as partners, coalitions, members, board, staff, and other government entities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Solidify and define AMCHP’s strategy around new funding opportunities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop an understanding of the strategic issues facing AMCHP and maintain its position as a leader in this changing environment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Analyze the operational structure of AMCHP staff and systems and create a realistic plan for measured growth, including ongoing professional development opportunities for staff&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop trust and working relationships with diverse stakeholders, including staff, board, members, government agencies and other diverse constituencies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop an in-depth understanding of the complexities of AMCHP, including how different state agencies function, and monitor the public health environment and its potential impact on members’ ability to focus on their missions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain regular contact with the board, funders and members to establish a regular communication pattern and a seamless transition&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Experience and Leadership Attributes&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Ideal candidates for this position will genuinely value a future where the health needs of women, children and families are prioritized, and demonstrate the willingness to lead AMCHP through some upcoming turbulent times. In addition to experience in leadership, management, supervision, financial and resource management, and board relations, a strong candidate will also bring a variety of experiences and attributes to AMCHP, including:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to provide visionary and strategic leadership and translate that vision into measurable strategies and concrete actions that advance the mission&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well-developed written and oral communications skills and style, including listening and messaging&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proven networking ability, exceptional interpersonal skills, development and understanding of complex relationships, with the ability to engage a diverse group of stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A background in public health and an understanding of the role of Title V in the public health arena, health reform, and the Affordable Care Act; and the importance of the family voice in health care&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An inspiring, supportive and inclusive leadership style with a successful track record of motivating, supporting, and developing staff&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 years’ professional experience of progressive leadership and management responsibility, preferably in a nonprofit organization, membership organization, or association&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A basic understanding of the legislative process and advocacy, with a well-developed political savvy and understanding of bureaucracy, including knowledge of local, state and federal public health programs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with change management and desire to complete a seamless transition in conjunction with the board and staff&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A strategic thinker with well-honed business acumen and a commitment to public service&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proven experience with fiscal management, budgeting, and operations, including responsibility for developing and managing at least a $4 million budget&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Successful track record in fund development including membership fees and dues, grants and philanthropic support, and the ability to identify new revenue streams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience supporting the board of directors in its governance role, fostering its ongoing development, and keeping it informed about internal conditions and external developments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An understanding of association management and the priority of member services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trustworthy with high integrity, flexibility, resilience, and a positive affect&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Desire, ability and willingness to travel nationally&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Proficiency in use of communications and office management software applications, with an awareness of web/social media applications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Master’s degree required; MPH preferred&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

<title>Executive Director - Weeksville Heritage Center - Brooklyn, New York</title>
<link>http://www.execsearches.com/non-profit-jobs/jobDetail.asp?job_id=26517</link>
<description>ABOUT WEEKSVILLE

YESTERDAY

During the 19th century, the village of Weeksville was a vibrant and independent free African American community based in Brooklyn, New York.  The settlement was named for an African American, James Weeks, who was among a group of African Americans who acquired the property in 1838 to create an intentional land-owning community.  Weeksville Heritage Center (WHC) is the steward for the three remaining houses, located on historic Hunterfly Road, which portray Weeksville during the eras of the 1860s, 1900s, and 1930s.  WHC emphasizes Weeksville’s history of sanctuary, refuge, independence, self-sufficiency, self-determination, and activism, as well as the contemporary expression of those qualities.

TODAY

Today, Weeksville Heritage Center is a multi-dimensional museum whose mission is to document, preserve and interpret the complex history of free African, Caribbean, and African American communities in Weeksville, Brooklyn, and beyond.  The organization seeks to create and inspire innovative, contemporary uses of history through research, education, the arts, and civic engagement.

Drawing inspiration from the history of the community, WHC is known for the guided tours of its Hunterfly Road historic homes, ongoing oral history projects, public programs such as the Garden Party Concert Series, Brilliant Corners Jazz Concert, Farmers Market, Emancipation Day Celebrations, Vaudeville Family Day, and so much more. 

Educational programming, including tours, takes place year-round, but Weeksville’s public programming season begins in May/June with the annual jazz concert and weekend farmers market, culminates in July with musical performances every Saturday, and concludes in September with film screenings, a lecture series and a Harvest Festival. Special events are announced throughout the year.

TOMORROW

WHC has completed construction on, and will soon open, a new 19,000 square foot Certified LEED Gold Sustainable Education and Cultural Arts Building (targeted for late 2013/early 2014), which will allow for year-round public programming.  The new facility includes a resource center, classrooms and media lab, workshops, oral history studio, collection spaces, 700 sq. ft. gallery and 200-seat performance space.  The 1.5-acre outdoor landscaped space includes a micro farm and heritage-based botanic collection.


THE POSITION

The Executive Director position is a unique leadership opportunity for an individual with initiative and an entrepreneurial spirit.  She/He will provide the vision, strategic direction, fundraising leadership, and management expertise for one of Brooklyn’s cultural treasures.

The Executive Director will continue to shape WHC’s institutional identity, including helping to determine the right balance of community, citywide and even national focus. She/He must be clear and consistent in articulating WHC’s mission and its relationship to its various communities, and must encourage the organization’s Board and staff to do the same.

Reporting to WHC’s Board, the Executive Director is ultimately responsible for all aspects of the organization, including: planning, programming, fundraising, fiscal operations, and marketing/communications.  She/He will manage a dedicated staff and an annual operating budget of approximately $1.5 million.

Serving as WHC’s chief spokesperson, the Executive Director will represent the organization broadly, encouraging partnerships and collaborations that advance WHC’s mission while providing the best possible historical, educational and cultural experiences for WHC’s audiences. 

WHC’s Executive Director will serve as one of Brooklyn’s important civic leaders and must be an active participant in Brooklyn’s ongoing growth strategies.  She/He will be expected to take advantage of the groundswell of interest in Brooklyn’s ongoing development and make a compelling case for Weeksville as a not-to-be-missed destination.

It is critical that within the first year, the Executive Director do the following:

•	Thoroughly understand Weeksville Heritage Center — its mission and values, history, culture, programs, partners and key stakeholders, operations and potential;

•	Gain the confidence of the Board, building relationships that continue to bring forth their best efforts and talents.  Develop a strong working relationship with the Board Chair and the Executive Committee;

•	Foster relationships of trust and cooperation with WHC’s staff, forging partnerships that develop and nurture their best talents;

•	Working closely with the Board and Acting Development Director, help the organization get back on firm financial footing, and begin to conceptualize a sustainable long-term growth strategy.  This will included establishing and maintaining personal relationships with key donors, partners, and stakeholders in order to encourage ongoing support, and beginning to cultivate a donor pool that extends beyond WHC’s current base;

•	Move WHC into its new educational/cultural center.  This will involve working very closely with the Department of Cultural Affairs (DCA) to ensure that the center’s build-out is complete, securing the certificate of occupancy, and setting up the annual maintenance fund required by DCA to allow for the building’s official transfer from the city to WHC.  Lead strategic discussions with the Board regarding a possible institutional partnership around the building’s ownership.

•	Explore a range of earned income strategies;

Communications and Marketing

•	Serve as primary spokesperson for WHC, proactively cultivating relationships with key decision makers throughout the community and citywide, articulating WHC’s vision and galvanizing the community around the organization.

•	Paying close attention to Brooklyn’s increasing popularity as both a residential and tourist destination, identify opportunities for WHC’s growth and greater participation/engagement; diversify and expand WHC’s audience;

•	Forge relationships within the community; personally integrate and become highly visible and involved within Brooklyn’s social, political and cultural communities;

•	Work closely with staff and consultants to develop marketing/PR strategies; providing executive approval of all institutional communications;
&amp;#8195;
Board Relations and Governance

•	Build and nurture good relationships with all Board members marked by open communication and responsiveness to issues affecting WHC’s strategic direction and operating health;

•	Help to identify and cultivate new trustees whose talents, interests and commitment will further WHC’s mission and expand support;

•	Attend Board meetings; work closely with the Executive Committee in strategic planning, policy development, articulation and implementation of organizational goals;

•	Support the Board Chair in encouraging all Board members to participate actively; help to support an effective committee structure.

About Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch:  
Public Citizen is a national, nonprofit advocacy organization founded in 1971 to represent the public interest in Congress, the executive branch and the courts. We fight for openness and democratic accountability in government; for social and economic justice in globalization and trade policies; for clean, safe and sustainable energy; for strong health, safety and environmental protections; for safe, effective and affordable medicines and health care and for the right of consumers to seek redress in the courts. We have six divisions based in our Washington, D.C. offices and an office in Texas

The mission of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch division is to ensure that in this era of globalization, a majority have the opportunity to enjoy America&apos;s promises: economic security, a clean environment, safe food, medicines and products, access to quality affordable services such as health care and the exercise of democratic decision-making about the matters that affect their lives.

Public Citizen started working on globalization and ‘trade’ issues in 1991 when we recognized that this was necessary simply to remain effective advocates for the public health, consumer safety, environmental and economic justice goals Public Citizen had promoted over decades. Motivating this strategic initiative was our realization that today’s international commercial agreements, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), were no longer mainly about trade per se. Rather, these far-reaching agreements were backdoor delivery mechanisms to implement an expansive, enforceable package of non-trade policies  - limits on financial regulation and food safety, new monopoly patent rights over medicines and seeds that limit access, new investor rights that promote job-offshoring and subject public interest policies to attack and more. This corporate-led version of globalization is designed to limit governments’ role in regulating the economy and to eliminate many of the public interest safeguards Public Citizen and like-minded organizations and activists had won over decades. And, it shifts decision-making on matters previously determined in national, state and local venues to international bodies where those affected by the decisions have no meaningful role.

Since its inception in 1995, GTW has been a leader in popularizing the globalization and trade debate by connecting these seemingly arcane policies to peoples’ everyday experiences – and helping people make a difference in the future of globalization by giving them the tools they need to educate their communities, hold Congress accountable for policy choices, and hit the streets to protest. GTW works with diverse national and international coalitions. For more information, please see our website: www.tradewatch.org

<title>Executive Director - Virginia Supportive Housing - Richmond, Virginia</title>
<link>http://www.execsearches.com/non-profit-jobs/jobDetail.asp?job_id=26398</link>
<description>Virginia Supportive Housing (VSH) seeks an exceptional leader to serve as its Executive Director to continue to advance its mission of ending homelessness in Virginia by providing permanent housing coupled with essential supportive services, and doing this in a way that transforms lives and communities.
 
VSH is the largest permanent housing provider in Virginia and one of the largest in the nation. The new executive director will join an organization with many assets, including its attractive properties, excellent and engaged board, skilled senior management team and staff, great relationships with the communities served, and stellar outcomes. This position will require high visibility with state, local and federal officials, donors and community organizations aligned with the VSH mission.  

&lt;b&gt;The Organization&lt;/b&gt;

VSH is a statewide non-profit that successfully ends the cycle of homelessness by providing permanent housing and necessary support services to homeless individuals. VSH develops, owns and operates more than 460 apartment units in Richmond, Hampton Roads and Charlottesville. Additionally, more than 225 units of scattered-site housing are provided.

The VSH model has been proven successful because of its two-pronged approach of pairing permanent housing with on-site supportive services. Residents receive personalized support from case managers who help them handle  their mental and physical health issues, provide employment counseling and other specific needs to keep each individual resident independently stable and off the street for good. 

The homeless individuals and the small number of families VSH serves represent the very lowest levels of income in its service areas (generally 30% or less than the area&apos;s median income). The individuals’ economic circumstances are often compounded by other challenges, including substance abuse, mental illness and physical disabilities. 

Residents lease their apartments and pay 30% of their monthly income or a minimum of $50 per month for rent. The end result: a 98% success rate of residents who ¬never return to the street.

Residential and program highlights include:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seven properties serving single adults (two in Richmond, one in Charlottesville and four in Hampton Roads), most of which have 60 studio units.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Four properties serving adults with disabilities (all in Richmond), including one dedicated to formerly homeless veterans, ranging from 6 to 14 units each.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Four properties serving 14 families (all in Richmond).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over 225 units of scattered site housing (141 in Richmond and 84 in Hampton Roads), with VSH housing staff working with landlords and paying them rental subsidies, and case managers providing in-home support services for individuals who are chronically homeless and/or medically vulnerable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A veterans program in Richmond and Petersburg (and soon to be Charlottesville) that serves veterans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness that served 300 people during the past year and a half.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In all VSH properties and housing programs, residents can stay as long as they wish, provided they can meet their commitments to pay rent and live within the guidelines of the property and the organization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On-site case management is provided to help people maintain their housing and become more independent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Counseling and financial literacy programs empower residents who are able to make the life changes needed to maintain jobs and ultimately move on to market rate housing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

VSH is governed by a 20-member board of directors. The current annual budget is $11 million which includes all of the 15 property budgets.  The operating budget not including the property operations is $7.5 million: revenue is 59% government, 24% fees, and 17% private philanthropy.  Current staff number more than 125, with a senior management team composed of four key leaders: a deputy executive director, the director of finance and administration, the director of mission advancement and director of communications and government relations. An expanded leadership team includes a director of quality assurance, two directors of support services – one to serve Central Virginia and the other serves Hampton Roads – a grants and contracts administrator, a director of housing development, a director of property management and a director of volunteer services.

In addition to organizational areas that include finance, communications, mission advancement/development and administration, the programmatic aspects of the organization include three interrelated units:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;Li&gt;Multi-family development (an in-house team that develops properties from concept to stabilized occupancy)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Property management (an in-house team that operates and maintains the properties and ensures consistent maximum occupancy)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support services (an in-house  team of social workers who provide the case management that includes assisting residents/clients with their mental and physical health issues, employment, financial literacy, and other needs so that residents remain stable in their housing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

More information can be found at www.virginiasupportivehousing.org.

&lt;b&gt;The Position&lt;/b&gt;

VSH has grown dramatically over the past 10 years, developing strong systems in its three programmatic areas (housing development, property management and support services) and an enviable track record.  With rapid growth comes the need for a stronger infrastructure and strategies. The new executive director will lead, with board commitment, the development of more sustainable funding strategies for mission advancement, administration and support services. He/she will also be joining an organization that is dedicated to ensuring planned growth and financial sustainability.
The new executive director will be supported by VSH’s recent expansions of its capacities in communications and mission advancement. 

Focusing on the future, the board and management team are eager to collaborate with the new executive director in several initiatives (1) to develop a more sustainable business model for support services, (2) to continue an endowment campaign to ensure financial return on investment, and (3) to lay the groundwork for a significant, multi-year capital campaign. (One property in Richmond will need to be replaced, in addition to the development of new properties and the expansion into other markets.)  Most importantly, VSH will be celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, which will provide an excellent opportunity to showcase the organization’s successful history and promote these initiatives.

Toward these ends, the priorities for the initial 12-18 months of the new executive director’s tenure include:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gaining a solid understanding of the organization, its teams, assets, communities and stakeholders, and building relationships with key community stakeholders, funders and governmental partners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Working with the board and mission advancement team to refine the organization’s resource development plan, refine and expand the potential of the endowment campaign, and solidify the plans for the capital campaign.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leading a strategic planning process that will define the direction of the organization’s mission under the new executive director’s tenure, including the exploration of new initiatives, future development opportunities, geographic expansion, and funding models for long-term sustainability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Reporting Relationships&lt;/b&gt;

Positions reporting to the executive director include: deputy executive director, director of finance and administration, director of mission advancement, and the director of communications/ government relations.

Positions reporting through the deputy executive director include: director of housing development, director of property management, and two directors of support services. 

&lt;b&gt;Key Responsibilities&lt;/b&gt;
Reporting to the board of directors, the executive director will provide leadership to the organization and manage its day-to-day affairs, both internal and external.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Organizational vision, direction and strategy&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work closely with the board and the senior management team to articulate the vision, set the strategic direction and refine the organization’s business strategy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lead the strategic planning process to advance the organization’s mission and define its outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;	Develop and implement annual operating plans/business plans to support the strategic plan objectives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Programmatic leadership and outcomes&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assume overall accountability for advancing the organization’s programmatic outcomes and impact; ensure the quality and integrity of the programs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Organizational management&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oversee operations in close collaboration with the deputy executive director to promote efficiency, quality, service and cost-effectiveness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop and monitor strategies for ensuring the long-term sustainability of the organization; oversee financial planning and management, working closely with the director of finance and administration to sustain the organization’s financial health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lead and develop the senior management team; foster a culture of communication and collaboration, continuous improvement, professional development and outstanding service.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grow and mentor a mission advancement/development department in all our market areas to create and execute an ambitious multi-year development plan to ensure a sustainable source of revenues to fund VSH&apos;s growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Board support&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support the board of directors in carrying out its governance role, fostering its development and providing for its succession.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide thorough, accurate information to keep the board appropriately informed of the organization’s performance, outlook and operating condition (financial and otherwise).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

<title>Chief Operating Officer - Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers - Camden, New Jersey</title>
<link>http://www.execsearches.com/non-profit-jobs/jobDetail.asp?job_id=26363</link>
<description>The Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers is a strategic initiative aimed at improving healthcare delivery for residents living in America’s poorest city, Camden, New Jersey.  Founded in 2002, the Camden Coalition is a collaboration of local hospitals, healthcare providers, community residents, and social service organizations.  With nearly 50 staff, the organization has developed a national reputation for its model of “hot spotting” with healthcare data and community-based outreach teams to improve the care of high cost, complex patients.  The Coalition work has been featured in The New Yorker article The Hot Spotters and a PBS Frontline special report.  

The Coalition has a wide breadth of activities including: care coordination, primary care and specialty care redesign, data sharing, analytics, research, workforce development, provider education, technical assistance, advocacy, policy change, and community organizing.  

The Coalition operates a growing regional health information exchange with real-time data from three local hospitals.  This data is used to target the Coalition’s community-based care coordination efforts with visits to the hospital bedside, home, shelter, and street corner if needed.  The Coalition is also redesigning the care model inside of local primary care and specialty care outpatient offices using classic business techniques such as market segmentation, workflow redesign, team-based service delivery, and data-driven management of supply and demand.  

To build a new healthcare workforce, the Coalition is providing experiential learning opportunities for college graduates through AmeriCorps positions as health coaches, for health professions students in rotating clerkships, and for practicing clinicians in a population health fellowship.

The Coalition is working across the State of New Jersey and the country to change public policy and build support for new models of care for the underserved.  The organization spearheaded an effort to pass legislation in New Jersey to create a Medicaid Accountable Care Organization Demonstration Project in October 2011.  The draft regulations have just been released and the program will begin in January 2014.  The program will permit the Coalition, and other similar organizations in NJ, to capture savings resulting from improvements in the delivery of healthcare services for patients.

The Coalition is collaborating with twelve communities in New Jersey and across the country to adapt the Coalition’s model and develop best practices for improving care for the underserved population.  The organization has become a nationally recognized leader in the new and evolving field of population health.  For more information about the organization please visit www.camdenhealth.org.

<title>Executive Director - VOICES for Alabama&apos;s Children - Montgomery, Alabama</title>
<link>http://www.execsearches.com/non-profit-jobs/jobDetail.asp?job_id=26335</link>
<description>VOICES for Alabama’s Children (VOICES) is seeking a seasoned, visionary, and energetic leader with keen political instincts to lead this premier child advocacy organization that works to ensure the well-being of children, youth and families in Alabama through research, public awareness and advocacy.

&lt;b&gt;The Organization&lt;/b&gt;
Founded in 1992 through the vision of leading child advocates, VOICES for Alabama’s Children was the first, and remains the only, organization to document the conditions of children in each of our state’s 67 counties, and advocate to see that those conditions are improved. Our vision is that all Alabama children will be safe, healthy, educated and secure in order to reach their potential. 

With funding and support from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, VOICES collects annual data on a county-by-county basis depicting how children are faring in terms of health, safety, education, family income and other factors that support their successful development. VOICES publishes the data in an annual Alabama Kids Count Data Book. Using the information from Alabama Kids Count and other research on specific issues, VOICES helps Alabamians understand the current conditions of the state’s children, how those conditions may be improved, and the consequences of failure to implement positive change.

In addition to research and public awareness, VOICES advocates to improve the lives of children by working with public and private officials. We provide information, communicate with elected  representatives and policy makers, and collaborate with other community partners to ensure Alabama’s children have the best chance to become responsible, productive adults. Some of the areas VOICES addresses include:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Early care and education&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Economic security&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Education (K-12)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Health&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Safety&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Challenges facing youth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
